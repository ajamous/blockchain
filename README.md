# TelecomsXChange -  Smart Contract for the Blockchain
This smart contract is responsible for processing important text data from buyers and sellers on the exchange to save it on the blockchain as a reference.

P.S: This smart contract publishes up to 32 bytes at a time.

How we use this Smart Contract at TelecomsXChange:

- Sellers can sync their payout (balance) to the blockchain

- Buyers can sync their prepaid balance to the blockchain

Since miners prefer smaller transactions because easier to fit them in block, the typical token transfer if around 50k gasm, our TX is 25k gas which is less and affordable.

We hope you find it useful and enable you to easily put important data on the blockchain.


What other potential uses:

This smart contract pushes any sort of text to the blockchain, so you can store any valuable data to the blockchain like CDRs, SDRs or simply any text that you think is valauble.
